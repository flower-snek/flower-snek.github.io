			<p>testing grounds - using seishun complex mods as a start since those are short, sweet, and have a little bit of everything</p>
			<h1> Seishun Complex (Hard) | id 12743 </h1>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">11, 19, 27</p>
				<p> from 11 to 12 there's a vert, from 19 to 20 there isn't, and then from 27 to 28
				there is, even though the song does the same thing. what i'd personally do is make none of these
				verts, then change 23->24 to a vert to accent the cymbal like at 39->40 (since you're not making 
				that a chord)</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">14, 22</p>
				<p>so at 14 the map is going to the guitar and does 621, while at 22 the guitar ends so 
				you instead map to the drums and do 449. this is fine in theory, but for me personally it feels 
				weird having the less "intense" sound of the drums as this minijack, since it stands out a lot more. 
				i'd consider just mapping the guitar as a 1-beat hold personally.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">33</p>
				<p>all the rest of these xx-xx patterns are 65 23 or something like that, why is this one different?</p>
			</div>
			<p>
			all of the above can be repeated for, in order, <br>
			43, 51, 59 <br>
			46, 54 <br>
			65
			</p>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">91</p> 
				<p>this vert kinda stands alone. instead of removing it, maybe introduce some more to make 
				this section feel a little more active. i could see some being added at 95, 99, 107, and 111 i guess? 
				idk up to you </p>
				<p> the counterpoint to adding more verts would be if you want to instead add more in the chorus to 
				scale up the difficulty, because these sections feel kinda similar right now</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="note comment">
				<p class="beat">115</p> 
				<p>i feel like you should change the patterning here to accent this a bit more (something 
				like 957? idk) but its technically fine as is</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">127 and repetitions</p>
				<p> similar to 91. even more so though since this is the chorus, so go wild. to 
				be more specific, what makes this a vert compared to 131, or what makes 131 *not* a vert compared 
				to 127?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">138, 202</p>
				<p> i can't tell what makes these minijacks compared to the other triplets. i'd assume its 
				going to the drums again but so is every other triplet</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">173-179, 237-243</p>
				<p>this feels really empty. might as well add notes at 174 and 178 to both fill 
				the empty space and continue mapping the drums. what you could do is, for example from 172,</p>
				<div class="p_notes">[23]-7-9-45-21-3-7</div>
			</div>
			<div class="note good">
				<p class="beat"> 184</p><p> good vert </p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">239</p>
				<p> similar to 33, why 6521 instead of 6523 like the rest </p>
			</div>
			<div class="note error">
				<p class="beat">261</p>
				<p> ouggghhhhh this (timing) gap makes me upset. every other section like this has had at 
				most 1/2 between streams and this is 3/4 which is just enough that it looks kinda like a 1/2 gap 
				and ughhhhhh just put a note at 262</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">269</p><p>ig this counts with 239 and 33 but i could see this staying just because its not *right next to* 
				a different pattern to the same sound</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note comment">
				<p class="beat"> 276 </p>
				<p>hey you should do</p> 
				<div class="p_notes">[89]7-[45]6-[23]1</div>
				<p>it'd be funny</p>
