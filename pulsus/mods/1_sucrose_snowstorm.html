			<p> honestly my only big problems with this map are a) some missing notes and b) that the 1/2 
streams are really simply patterned. as in almost all row streams. effects are great as always. onto the mods. </p>

				<p class="beat">0</p>

				by the coloring it seems you're intending to do this 4 note grouping with the patterns, and it 
kinda shows with the 7898 7865 4565 etc. the thing is it kinda plays more like 789878 654565 - if 
you want to accent that grouping, there's two ideas i have:
first, you could keep the 7898 there every time and move the 7865 out of the way, like this:
<div class="p_notes">7898453278981265</div>
second, you could do a similar idea but moving that mini-rowstream, at the cost of a slight overlap:
<div class="p_notes">7898126512327865</div>
or
<div class="p_notes">7898453245651298</div>
(which would probably continue with 1232 instead of 7898 to continue the pattern)
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="note good">
				<p class="beat">16</p>
				<p>
				when i said the 1/2 streams are really simply patterned, this is the exception! this is good! 
do this for some of the other streams!!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">20, 28</p>
				<p>
				patterning nitpick, i dont think these rowstreams really go to anything
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note error">
				<p class="beat">23</p>
				<p>
				not a fan of this pattern:
<div class="p_notes">65156</div>
it reads reallllllly poorly. recommend rearranging some of the streams around it so that the 65 
goes on 98 instead
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note comment">
				<p class="beat">30</p>
				<p>
				i think objectively these chord jacks should probably be single note jacks but its kinda 
funny so ill let someone else complain about it instead
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note error">
				<p class="beat">43.5, 58.5</p>
				<p>
				two things. one, i don't like 653 type patterns personally and i feel there was no reason 
for this to be one. two, this is a bit of a spacing issue:
<div class="p_notes">653-2</div>
reads more like
<div class="p_notes">65-32</div>
i'd recommend changing this part to go something like
<div class="p_notes">651-32-7-6-[12]</div>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">67, 99</p>
				<p>
				similar to 43.5, i just dont like these one-handed patterns, especially with the 
inconsistent rhythms. this is more fine tho bc there aren't any /obvious/ spacing issues
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">85</p>
				<p>
				this pattern just feels not at all representative of the song. i would put some minijacks here, 
so like
<div class="p_notes">3446645-3</div>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">92</p>
				<p>
				missing note?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note error">
				<p class="beat">127</p>
				<p>
				uhhh, dont like this 1/2 1-4, why not do
<div class="p_notes">1-654-9-[78]</div>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">131.5</p>
				<p>
				missing note?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note error">
				<p class="beat">136, 152</p>
				<p>
				i cannot tell what you're mapping here. it seems like you're mapping the... uh... 
xylophone? from 136 to 140.5 but you're missing notes at 136.5 and 140. then you switch to the 
drums for some reason at 141 i guess.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">147.5</p>
				<p>
				missing note?
				</p>
			</div>
			<p> the above 3 are repeated for the second half of this section </p>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">192</p>
				<p>
				ok so this is one of the 1/2 streams i was talking about at the start. its just. boring. so 
here's what you can do instead: the sound you're mapping to here seems to go have a repeating-
every-3-notes pattern, like 3-1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-... until 206 where it goes 1-2-3-2- before repeating 
again. you can represent this with having streams that are patterned in groups of 3, patterns like
<div class="p_notes">126459786453</div>
and
<div class="p_notes">426759126783</div>
and the like, you know?
would also change the streams at 264, 280, etc accordingly

			<div class="note comment">
				<p class="beat">254</p>
				<p>
				you did this right, what happened at 127 lmao
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">280, 312</p>
				<p>
				hmmm dont like this 5421.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">319.75</p>
				<p>
				missing note?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">320</p>
				<p>
				same comment as the intro, with the row and s/z streams kinda melting together a bit 
much here (especially things like 335, where its supposed to be s/z -> row -> s/z but it just feels 
like a really long rowstream)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">384</p>
				<p>
				same as 192
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">415.75</p>
				<p>
				missing note?
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>snow way out B: same mods as snow way out A</p>
			<div class="note warn">
				<p class="beat">479.75</p>
				<p>
				would recommend extending this stream two notes so it ends on the start of the next 
section
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="note neutral">
				<p class="beat">487</p>
				<p>
				same as 320
				</p>
			</div>
			<p> effects are good, no comments </p>
