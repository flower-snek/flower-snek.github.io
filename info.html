				hi, i'm arie (she/they). but if you're on this site you probably know me as snekk (or something like that). i'm a junior year computer science major + physics minor, and i play far too many <a href="game.html">rhythm games</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				this website is pretty much just serving as a playground for learning and/or experimenting with html and css, as well as hosting anything i may need to host online. maybe at one point i'll add a sort of blog or something? idk. i'll figure it out later.
				feel free to stop by every now and then if you care about what i'm up to though! 
				and if not... bye i guess?
				</p>
				<p> this site will have more added to it whenever i feel like it, which may be soon or may not. honestly i should probably have some sort of update log but ehhhhhhh i'm lazy. </p>
				
				<p> site last updated feb 02 2023 </p>
