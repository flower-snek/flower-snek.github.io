				<p>this section has nothing. i just wanted a link to my <a href="notitg/index.html">NotITG charts</a> tbh.</p>
				<p>i also might as well link this <a href="sg2stages/pickban.html">samurai gunn 2 stage selector</a> thing i made a while ago. it's pretty much depricated though, i probably won't update it for any new maps since i haven't played the game in several months</p>
				<p>anyways this page will probably have more things eventually.</p>
