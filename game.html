					<h3> rhythm games </h3>
					<h4> <a href="notitg/n_index.html">NotITG</a> </h4>
					<p> NotITG is a funny&#8482; rhythm game. i make charts for it sometimes! </p>
					
					<h4> <a href="rhythm/taiko.html">osu!taiko</a></h4>
					<p> look there isn't a taiko machine near me and i don't want to buy a controller rn. anyways i started playing in december-ish and its fun, this page just has a goal checklist</p>
					
					<h4> beatmania </h4>
					<p> aaaaaaaaaaaaa i need to play this more but i haven't felt like it. i'll make a page for it when i do, it'll probably be like taiko with a goal checklist n' all. 6th dan</p>
					
					<h3> not rhythm games </h3>
					<h4> <a href="pokemon/p_index.html">Pokemon</a> </h4>
					<p> creachures. i'll probably document any competitive teams i make here, as well as any randomizers i may do (because i like doing weird randomizers, and keeping a log of those a. sounds fun and b. will help with actually commiting to finishing one maybe) </p>
					
					<h4> Other </h4>
					<p>i might as well link this <a href="sg2stages/pickban.html">samurai gunn 2 stage selector</a> thing i made a while ago. it's pretty much depricated though, i probably won't update it for any new maps since i haven't played the game in several months.</p>
